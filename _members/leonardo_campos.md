I have a degree in Computational Engineering, with an emphasis in Systems and Computing, and a Master’s in Computational and Electric Engineering. As a researcher, I have started designing intelligent systems using a reinforcement learning technique for routing packets in simulated networks. I have also been working as a developer since 2004 in the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte - UFRN, obtaining vast experience in Java programming language, web/mobile systems, relational and non-relational databases, project management, and agile processes. I worked on many projects which yielded software patents to the university. I'm currently a Ph.D. student at Bioinformatics Multidisciplinary Environment's Graduate Program from the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte - UFRN. I have experience in the areas of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, Data Science, Computational Biology, and Systems Biology.
