I hold a degree in Information Systems from UNI-RN (2007) and a degree in Biomedicine from UFRN (2021). I worked at Petrobras S.A. in the IT and TCOM (Telecommunications) fields. In the development areas, I utilized the Pascal/Delphi programming language. I managed network infrastructure based on TCP/IP protocols with support for Linux servers and applications. I also managed TCOM infrastructure with support for routing protocols such as OSPF, RIP, and BGP, involving both local and wireless network protocols.
