Masters student in Bioinformatics at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte (UFRN) and a graduate in Biomedicine from the same institution. My academic journey is focused on omics data analysis, with an emphasis on Single Cell, RNA-seq, Metagenomics, and the Evolution of Biological Systems. Since 2021, I have been part of the BioME team, where I apply computational approaches to investigate evolutionary patterns and protein interaction networks, contributing to a deeper understanding of molecular complexity and large-scale biological mechanisms.
