Graduating in Biomedicine from the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte since 2018.1, expected to be completed in 2024.2. My focus of interest is in the area of Bioinformatics, with an emphasis on RNA-seq data analysis and Metagenomics. I am currently part of the BioME team, where I work as a Scientific Initiation Fellow. My participation in BioME involves the application of Bioinformatics tools to analyze different types of data and biological processes. At the same time, I work in the area of Microbiology as a monitor in the Medical Bacteriology discipline. In this context, I collaborate in the development of the bacteria identification manual aimed at academic teaching, in addition to providing assistance in practical classes. This initiative has provided improvements in bacterial identification techniques and the opportunity to contribute to the teaching of microbiology. Previous experiences include monitoring the subjects of Biochemistry and organic chemistry, offering support to students and helping them learn fundamental concepts. Furthermore, I participated in another Scientific Initiation project also focused on the area of Bioinformatics, in which I discovered my interest in the area. My goal is to pursue a research career in Bioinformatics, I am open to research and collaboration opportunities in order to expand its applications in the biomedical field and contribute to scientific advances.
