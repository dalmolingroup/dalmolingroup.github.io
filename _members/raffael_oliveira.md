I hold a Bachelor's degree in Biomedicine with a specialization in Clinical Analysis/Pathology from the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte - UFRN (2014), where I conducted research with a focus on bioinformatics applied to nucleic acids. I used this approach to analyze economically significant viruses. I completed a Master's degree in Biochemistry from the Graduate Program in Biochemistry at UFRN (2017), with a project also centered on bioinformatics, this time employing systems biology approaches to analyze the evolution of gene systems in Arabidopsis thaliana. I earned a Ph.D. in Bioinformatics from the Graduate Program in Bioinformatics at UFRN (2021), where I studied transcription factors as potential master regulators in the development of complex inflammatory diseases.
