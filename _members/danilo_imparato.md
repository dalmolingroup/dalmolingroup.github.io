I am a Master's student in Bioinformatics and BSc in Biomedicine at UFRN, where I carry out research in systems biology and deal with data integration, biological networks analysis, the evolution of biological systems and the development of computational tools. I also work as a bioinformatician at the genomics lab Mendelics, developing analysis pipelines for genomic data as well as developing LIMS for multiple sequencing platforms. I am an IT technician experienced in R, data visualization, full-stack development and databases.
