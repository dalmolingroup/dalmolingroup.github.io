I am a computer science technician from the Federal Institute of Brasília (IFB). Currently, I am pursuing a bachelor's degree in Biological Sciences at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte (UFRN). I am also a participant in the Institutional Program for Scientific Initiation Scholarships (PIBIC) funded by CNPq, working in the bioinformatics laboratory at the Institute Metrópole Digital (IMD).
